 - There should be 3 heating levels - Low (X = 110s, Y = 25s) Medium (X = 120s, Y = 30s) and High (X = 130s, Y = 35s).
 - After that, the user should select the Speed - 2.5 minutes, 5 minutes or 8 minutes 

 Once, the user confirms this:
 - start a timer for the time selected as Speed
 - Lock the door
 - Start the countdown for the speed timer
 - heater begins to run (for x seconds) 
 - after 30 seconds, unlock the door, and allow the person to enter.
 - Check the weight:
        - if the weight is 0 for 15 seconds, then turn off the heater and pause the timer X.
        - Prompt the user to enter the chamber
        - If the user enters the chamber (weight > 50), continue the heater until X reaches 0.
        
        - if the weight is lower or equal to than 50 kg but greater than 0, turn off the heater after 5 seconds and display "Warning: not an adult" 

        - if the weight of the person is greater than 50:
                - continue the heating operation until X reaches 0.
                - After that, turn off the heater for Y seconds.
                - After this, turn on the heater for Y seconds.
                - keep doing this cycle, until the timer 'Speed' comes to 0
                - while doing this cycle, keep checking the temperature sensor every 5 seconds. If the temperature exceeds 150, turn off the heater for Y seconds and start the cycle after that.
